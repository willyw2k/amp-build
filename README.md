# amp-build

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/zerodevx/amp-build)

An opinionated [AMP](https://amp.dev) static site build and static site generator.

Use this to create full-featured websites that are also AMP-validated pages. Does not require compilation or
a build step during development, because that's so passÃ©. Runs almost entirely off NPM scripts, because things
shouldn't be so complicated.


Features:

* Super optimized build.
* Tailwindcss v1 as utility CSS.
* PurgeCSS v1 to remove unused CSS.
* HTMLMinifier v4 for minification.
* Baked in Material Icons.
* Nested navigation menu.
* XML Sitemap.
* Workbox v4 for offline goodness. (WIP)
* App Shell PWA architecture. (WIP)


## Quick-start

### Install

I recommend installing this repo as a `git-subtree`. Here's an [excellent writeup](https://codewinsarguments.co/2016/05/01/git-submodules-vs-git-subtrees/) on this.


```
git subtree add --prefix amp-build https://github.com/zerodevx/amp-build tags/vX.X.X --squash
```

where `X.X.X` is the latest release semver.


Next, install dependencies.

```
cd amp-build
npm install
```

### Initialise

Scaffold the `src` directory.

`npm run scaffold`


### Serve and run

Start the local server.

`npm run serve`

Point your web browser to `http://localhost:8000/src/site/` - no build step required.


### Upgrade

To upgrade `amp-build` to a newer version,

`git subtree pull --prefix amp-build  https://github.com/zerodevx/amp-build tags/vX.X.X --squash`

where `X.X.X` is the newer release semver.



## Usage


### Directory structure

```
src/
  site/           -> site structure goes here
  layouts/        -> page templates go here
  images/         -> images go here
  snippets/       -> reusable HTML chunks go here
  styles/         -> for tailwind to generate styles.css
  scripts/        -> insert-snippet.js
  pwa/            -> PWA-related stuff
```


### Site

During development, by design, everything should work without compilation. Simply run any http server
off the `amp-build` directory at `http://localhost:8000`, or run:

`npm run serve`

Visit your page at `http://localhost:8000/src/site`.

Reference all links by their *absolute* url, for example:

`<a href="http://localhost:8000/src/site/giraffes/">What are giraffes?</a>`


### Snippets

Reusable HTML blocks go into snippets (located at `/snippets`). Insert snippets into page using a `script` tag,
`snippet` attribute, and source to `src/scripts/insert-snippet.js`. For example:

`<script snippet="header.html" src="http://localhost:8000/src/scripts/insert-snippet.js"></script>`


### Default Snippets

```
snippets/header.html          -> Header
snippets/footer.html          -> Footer
snippets/icons.html           -> Icon meta tags
snippets/amp-components.html  -> Default amp-components for every page
snippets/analytics.html       -> Default amp-analytics for every page
```


### Images

All images go into `src/images`. Reference all images by their *absolute* url, for example:

`<amp-img src="http://localhost:8000/src/images/short-giraffe.jpg" width="500" height="500" layout="responsive"></amp-img>`


### Minifying Images

Imagemin takes a long time (and really should only be run once), so minify the images in `src/images/` using:

`npm run build:images`

During build, the `src/images/` directory will be copied directly without further modifications.


### Favicons

I recommend using https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate your favicons. Place all favicons into `images/icons`
directory. They will be moved into site root at build. Update `snippets/icons.html` with the associated meta tags.
Note that `images/icons` will be ignored during `imagemin` minification so as to preserve your quality settings.


### Layouts

By default, new pages are generated from `src/layouts/default.html`. This serves as the template whenever a new page
is scaffolded.

Add a new page:

`npm run scaffold:page -- <url> <optional: template>`

For example:

`npm run scaffold:page -- /about/services section`

This copies `src/layouts/section.html` to `src/site/about/services/index.html`. If the directory does not exist,
it will be created.


### Adding Pages Manually

You can add new pages yourself. Simply create the new directory and copy an existing `index.html` in as a reference
template, and ensure that placeholder comments (for eg. `<!--sw:start ... sw:end-->`) remain.

```
mkdir src/site/my-new-page
cp src/site/index.html src/site/my-new-page
```


### Styles

Use tailwind classes to construct your page. If you wish to make changes to `src/styles/tailwind.configjs` (for theming),
or `src/styles/tailwind.css` to add more functional classes - edit the files, then run the following to regenerate
`styles.css`:

`npm run build:tailwind`


### Config

Set global configuration at `src/config.json`.

| Key                 | Type          | Description                              |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| stagingUrl          | String        | Base URL of staging site                 |
| productionUrl       | String        | Base URL of production site              |


## Builds

### Test build locally

Generate your build locally into the `build/` directory.

`npm run build`

Build can be tested by pointing your web browser to `http://localhost:8000/build`.

### Staging build

Ensure that `stagingUrl` has been defined in `src/config.json`. Run

`npm run build-staging`

The generated bundle in `build/` directory can then be published in your staging server.

### Production build

Ensure that `productionUrl` has been defined in `src/config.json`. Run

`npm run build-production`

The generated bundle in `build/` directory can then be published in your production server.


## TO-DOs

### LD+JSON

Make a better way to automate this.


### Service Worker

Integrate service worker generation into build.


### PWA/App Shell

Build should eventually become a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), where AMP-validated pages
are indexed by search engines and act as an entry point to a complete PWA app.

At the moment, [Amp Shadow](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-shadow-doc.md) does not
seem to be working very well, and it's not clear if AMP devs are continuing work on it.

Also, during proof-of-concept it's discovered that not all AMP components work as expected after being piped in.
